## UX Design

Design was based on a 'Bauhaus' colour scheme and design ethos. Bauhaus is a 20th century German design school of thought that follows the principal tenant of "form follows function and less is more". This style is characterised by a purposeful lack of ornamentation and a focus on clean lines to return forms to their essential elements. The style often includes the use of geometric shapes such as squares, triangles and circles.

In my design, I have opted for a clean minimalistic style of interface which follows the bauhaus principles and colour palette. This will aid in the accsessiblity and usability of the site.
